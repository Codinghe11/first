  <h2>Jordan's life</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan" target="_blank" title="Jordan wikipedia">Jordan</a></strong> (Arabic: الأردن; tr. Al-ʾUrdunn [al.ʔur.dunː])<img src="jordan.jpg" width="100%"> <p>officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is a country in Western Asia.
    It is situated at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe, within the Levant region, on the East Bank of the Jordan River.
    Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the northeast, Syria to the north, and Israel, Palestinian West Bank, and the Dead Sea to the west.
    In the southwest, it has a 26 km (16 mi) coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. The Gulf of Aqaba separates Jordan from Egypt.
    Amman is Jordan's capital and largest city, as well as its economic, political, and cultural centre.</p>

    Modern-day Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom.
    Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom, the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, and the Ottoman Empire.
    After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France.
    The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then Emir, Abdullah I, and the emirate became a British protectorate.
    In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan,
    but was renamed in 1949 to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967.
    Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in 1988, and became the second Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 194.
    Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation.
    The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy, but the king holds wide executive and legislative powers.
